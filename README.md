# Failure-Analysis-of-OceanGate-Titan-Submersible
This was for my Mechanics of Machine Project 


Description:

Conducted a comprehensive stress and failure analysis of the OceanGate Titan submersible using advanced mechanics of materials.
Evaluated axial stress, combined loading, and principal stresses to determine structural integrity under extreme underwater pressures.
Utilized carbon fiber epoxy composite with an elastic modulus of 138.8 GPa for material simulations.
Applied Mohr's Circle and failure theories to identify critical failure points and predict breaking stress.
Tools used: ANSYS, CATIA.

Key Achievements:

Gained expertise in structural failure prediction techniques.
Strengthened skills in computational mechanics and real-world problem-solving.
Developed a methodology for failure analysis of submersibles under extreme environmental conditions.
